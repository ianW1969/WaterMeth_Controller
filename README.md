# WaterMeth_Controller
Hello,

This code is for a WaterMeth controller with change lights & buzzer for an Audi Mk1 TT 225 Quattro 2002 UK spec Bosch ME7.5 ECU.
Important point to note this car does not use the ODB2 CANBUS standards and does not deliver the CANBUS via the ODB2 port (it uses K-Line)
the power train CANBUS can be tapped from the Green connector at the back of the dash pod pin 18 CAN HI, pin 19 CAN LOW.
